    <div class="taragenyxAbout"><h1>Creative branding</h1>
      <span class="topLine"></span>
      <p>During my University education at the Glasgow School of Art, I worked part time as a design intern for Taragenyx, a biomedical startup. My job mainly consisted of creating a brand for their company, and creating market materials <span class="paraShortIpad"> such as presentations; web content and business cards and pamphlets.
    One of my main and on-going projects whilst working for Taragenyx, shown here, was the company culture deck; a series of slides that explained the values and goals of the company to their future employees and prospective investors.</span>
    </p></div>

    <div class="focusAbout"><h1>Game Development</h1>
      <span class="topLine"></span>
      <p>Focus Games was my first, full time professional role, after leaving university; I began working there as an intern to the former lead designer; who’s role and responsibilities I later took over. My work with Focus Games puts me in a unique position as I am able to be involved with both print and digital design.<span class="paraShortIpad"> My role in print design involves; creating board games, packaging design and leaflet design. My role in digital design includes app/web design and development, as well as designing marketing content for social media and email campaigns as well as motion graphic & videography for marketing purposes.</span>
    </p></div>

    <div class="uniAbout"><h1>Story Telling</h1>
      <span class="topLine"></span>
      <p> My final thesis project was an investigation into the relationships and attachments people form to animated characters, similar to those created in Chuck Jones and Norman McLaren’s motion graphics.<span class="paraShortIpad"> My goal was to take these linear relationships and replace them with a non linear narrative that allowed the ‘viewer’ to become part of the relationships and emotions that the shapes experienced.</span>
    </p></div>


        <div class="freelanceAbout"><h1>URL Shortner</h1>
          <span class="topLine"></span>
          <p>A URL shortening web app bit using JS and MongoDB
        </p></div>

        <div class="hausAbout"><h1>App Development</h1>
          <span class="topLine"></span>
          <p>The Apple Store Presentation project was a group project that was undertaken with my class at the beginning of my 2nd year of my Digital Culture degree. For this project the class was set the task of creating an app for the Ipad, using LiveCode, a platform for building native mobile, desktop and server applications.<span class="paraShortIpad"> The app was called Secret Glasgow, and allowed people to explore different parts of Glasgow, highlighting often unseen areas of Glasgow. When the user had found the area, they were able to take a picture of the location through the app, to unlock other information about that location, and to point them in the direction of other secret places across Glasgow.</span>
        </p></div>


            <div class="soundAbout"><h1>Creative Coding</h1>
              <span class="topLine"></span>
              <p>  I took on the Interactive Web Design project near the end of my 3rd year of my Digital Culture degree. The project explored different coding languages, such as Javascript; HTML and CSS.<span class="paraShortIpad"> For this project we were told to explore and experiment with what we would like to base our 4th year thesis project on. A lot of my interests and research was based on Norman McLaren and Chuch Jones, two North American pioneers in animation.Chuck jones, probably the more recognisable of the two, was responsible for many of the Looney Toons characters.</span>
            </p></div>


            <div class="normanAbout"><h1>News Aggrigator</h1>
              <span class="topLine"></span>
              <p>A news aggregation website utilising newsapi ajax request and built with JQUERY, HTML, CSS and animated with animate.css
            </p></div>

            <div class="hatAbout"><h1>Projection Mapping</h1>
              <span class="topLine"></span>
              <p> The Projection Mapping project was a two part project that I took on in 3rd year of my Digital Culture degree. The projects explored projection mapping in the Mackintosh building; using a mapping programme called vpt7.<span class="paraShortIpad"> vpt7 used an interface for mapping content that we created such as videos and images, which were made using After Effects.
</span>

            </p></div>

            <div class="arduinoAbout"><h1>SWAPI APP</h1>
              <span class="topLine"></span>
              <p>creating board games, packaging design and leaflet design,
                designing and developing apps as well as designing marketing.
            </p></div>

            <div class="appAbout"><h1>Arduino Experiments</h1>
              <span class="topLine"></span>
              <p>  I took on the Interactive Objects project at the end of my second year during my Digital Culture degree. The project was to create an everyday interactive object; my goal was to create an installation to go along with the object.<span class="paraShortIpad"> I decided to create a sound sensitive interactive mask using an arduino; that would light up and change as the user played different sounds to the mask.
            </p></span>
          </div>


            <div class="dataAbout"><h1>Sound Visulisation</h1>
              <span class="topLine"></span>
              <p>  The Moving Shapes project was one that I took on in my third year of my Digital Culture degree. The project was meant to allow us to explore maya, a 3D modelling programme, and to create a video of these objects that we created.<span class="paraShortIpad"> For this project I collaborated with a friend who mixes his own music; together we tried to visualise the sound that he was creating, this allowed me to be more flexible when creating my shapes; which were designed from the sounds that my friend was creating; rather than real life.
            </p></span>
          </div>

            <div class="xtraAbout"><h1>Haus Apparel</h1>
              <span class="topLine"></span>
              <p>Haus Apparel was the brain-child of two young design students; Myself and a friend who also studied design. We were looking for a way reach a broader audience with our design work, and so we began creating pieces of clothing that we would be proud to wear.<span class="paraShortIpad">
               We created and launched the independent brand; and retailed in both Glasgow and Liverpool, as well as at clothing fairs. The brand design was heavily influenced by the Bauhaus art movement; and offered high quality goods released in limited quantity.
            </p></span>
